## Install

First, clone this repo:
```
git@github.com:jzhzhang/Uni-NaVid.git
```
Then install the Package and dependences:
```
conda create -n uninavid python=3.10 -y
conda activate uninavid
cd Uni-NaVid
pip install --upgrade pip  # enable PEP 660 support
pip install -e .
```
Finall, install the flash-attn package:
```
pip install flash-attn==2.5.9.post1
```

## Preparation

### Model

To train our model, you need to download the vision encoder and the language model. Below are the links to download the models in our paper:

| Model type | Model name | Download | 
|------|------|------|
| Encoder | EVA-CLIP | [ckpt](https://storage.googleapis.com/sfr-vision-language-research/LAVIS/models/BLIP2/eva_vit_g.pth)|
| Pretrain model | Vicuna-7B | [ckpt](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5)|
| Finetuned model | Uni-NaVid (7B) | [ckpt](https://huggingface.co/Jzzhang/Uni-NaVid/tree/main/uninavid-7b-full-224-video-fps-1-grid-2)|

### Data

We provide a small subset of the data used in our paper to facilitate quick reproduction and customization with your own data. The data can be downloaded from [here](https://huggingface.co/Jzzhang/Uni-NaVid/tree/main/Nav-Finetune). The data is collcted from navigation tasks including the training splits of [VLN-CE](https://github.com/jacobkrantz/VLN-CE) R2R and RxR, [EVT-Bench](https://github.com/wsakobe/TrackVLA), [ObjectNav](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13171), [EQA](https://embodiedqa.org/). **Note that due to licensing restrictions, we did not use the [L3MVN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05501) method for ObjectNav limiation learning, which may result in a slight performance drop in ObjectNav evaluation.**

We recommend organizing your project directory as follows
```
Uni-NaVid
├── data
    ├── Nav-Finetune
        ├── nav_videos
        ├── open_uninavid_sampled_500.json
├── model_zoo
    ├── eva_vit_g.pth
    ├── <vicuna_weights> # optinoal, if you want to finetune from vicuna
    ├── <uninavid_weights> 
├── scripts
├── uninavid
├── test_cases # optinoal, if you want to offline evaluate uni-navid
```

## Train

Please set the `DATA_PATH` and `MODEL_PATH` in the `uninavid_stage_1.sh` and `uninavid_stage_2.sh` scripts to your data and model paths.

If you want to finetune from Vicuna-7B (make sure you collect sufficient data):
```
bash uninavid_stage_1.sh
```

If you want to  finetune based on Uni-NaVid:
```
bash uninavid_stage_2.sh
```


## Evaluation
During evaluation, the model leverages online token merging (`run_type=eval`), achieving an inference speed of approximately 5 Hz on a single A100 GPU. By employing more advanced techniques, such as quantization, the speed can be further enhanced.


### Offline Evaluation
We provide the offline evaluation code of Uni-NaVid on real-world videos, including a VLN sample `vln_1` and a tracking sample `tracking_1`. You can download the sample videos from [here](https://huggingface.co/Jzzhang/Uni-NaVid/tree/main/test_cases).

```
python offline_eval_uninavid.py test_cases/vln_1 Ourpur_dir # or test_cases/tracking_1
```
